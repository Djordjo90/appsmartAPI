## Instructions

### Run the code
If you want to run tests, you need to do the following:
- in project path, open cmd/terminal and run this command: npm install
- in project path, open cmd/terminal and run this command: npm run cy-run

Tests will be launched and in project path you will get 3 new folders related to the test report (reports, results and screenshots folder).

### Note
I didn't know that the site I chose was so unstable (error 429 - To many requests), so it takes a little patience if you want to get a successful result for the first 2 tests.
The other 2 tests have a bug, because a successful response is obtained when a request is sent to get an employee without an id.
